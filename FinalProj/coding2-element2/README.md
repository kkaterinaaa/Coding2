Welcome to my Project! This project is my final project.

# Project Name: Connective

Description: 
Connective, taking interactivity and collaboration at its core, is about connecting people, enabling participants to communicate, interact, and create together despite physical distances. It takes a step further from conventional art creation tools by allowing the hand movements of two different participants to interact in real-time, drawing lines and shapes that represent their collaborative effort. In this project, the act of creation is more like a share journey than a solitary endeavour. It is a testament to the power of technology in bridging gaps and fostering human connections through creative expression. In a world where digital interfaces often isolate individuals behind screens, this project serves as a bridge, turning solitary interactions into a shared experience. Moreover, transforming individual gestures into collective art, it invites participants to explore new forms of communication and interaction.
