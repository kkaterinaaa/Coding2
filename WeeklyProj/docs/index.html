            <p>This project focuses on the prejudices faced by minority groups during their growth process and demonstrates how they overcome these biases by coming to terms with their inner selves.  I was responsible for the second scene in the short film. In this scene, the user uses the mouse to control the white crow to approach the black crow, but as soon as the black crow detects the approach of the white crow, they fly away. This scene describes a lonely white crow who wants to make friends but is isolated, alluding to a dilemma that someone will face when growing up.</p>

            <h2>Lab1-RavenProject-Demo</h2>
            <p>This is the demo I made to achieve the final scene, in which the white circle represents the white crow and the black circle represents the black crow. The code has been organized and summarized in the final project, so if you are interested in the implementation code of this scenario, you can visit this demo. The core logic of this scene is that the black circle has three fixed points where it can stay (let's call them landing points). The user controls the white circle by mouse. When the white circle is close to the black circle and is within the setting range, the black circle will move to other empty footholds (this means that the black circles will not go to the same foothold at the same time).</p>

            <p>This design creates a dynamic text effect that presents letters or words in a unique and engaging way. By converting the text into a matrix of dots and applying Perlin noise-based distortions and dynamic connecting lines to the dots, a seemingly three-dimensional effect is created. This design not only showcases novel expressions of text, but also explores the possibilities in digital art and procedurally generated art, stimulating the audience's new understanding and imagination of text and art. In this project, users can interact with letter effects by moving their mouse. In addition, the effect can be applied to different characters by simply changing the input text content.</p>

            <h2>Lab3-HandPose</h2>
            <p>This project uses the p5.js and ml5.js libraries to implement an interactive gesture recognition visualization tool. Capture the user's gestures through the camera, use the HandPose model provided by ml5.js to identify the key points of the hand, and then dynamically draw the key points of the hand and its skeleton on the canvas. Dynamic changes in color and shape are incorporated into the design to enhance visual effects and user interaction. This design provides users with a new interactive experience by combining advanced gesture recognition technology with dynamic artistic expression. It not only demonstrates the application of digital technology in artistic creation, but also explores the future development direction of digital interactive art.</p>
